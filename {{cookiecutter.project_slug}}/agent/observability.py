"""Structured observability: JSON logging, tracing, call instrumentation, PII redaction.

`instrument` wraps `agent/tools/*` functions -- the boundary this project actually
controls. Agent Engine's managed runtime drives the ADK `Runner` internally, so a
decorator on `Runner.run_async` would never fire in production; tool calls are invoked
by our own code regardless of where the agent runs, so that's the choke point used here.

Destinations
------------
**Logs go to stdout, and that is sufficient.** Agent Engine forwards container
stdout/stderr to Cloud Logging under the log names
`aiplatform.googleapis.com/reasoning_engine_stdout` and `..._stderr` -- verified against
a live deployment, where the JSON lines below arrived intact with no client library
involved. `read_logs.sh` reads exactly those.

A previous revision of this file also attached `CloudLoggingHandler`, on the belief that
stdout was *not* forwarded. That belief came from a deployment where no application logs
appeared at all -- which turned out to be a disabled `_Default` log sink in the GCP
project, discarding every non-audit entry regardless of how it was written. With the sink
enabled, every event arrived twice: once via stdout and once via the API handler. The
handler was removed as redundant. If logs ever appear to vanish again, check
`gcloud logging sinks describe _Default` before changing anything here.

Traces are different: nothing forwards them, so `CLOUD_TRACE_ENABLED` configures an
OpenTelemetry exporter that writes to Cloud Trace directly, and every `@instrument`ed
call becomes a span. It is off by default so a local `make dev` never writes to a real
project; `deployment/deploy.py` turns it on for the deployed agent, and passes
`OTEL_EXPORTER_GCP_TRACE_PROJECT_ID` alongside it -- the exporter otherwise falls back to
`google.auth.default()`, which inside the Agent Engine container resolves no project and
fails every export with `INVALID_ARGUMENT: Invalid project id in name!`.

Telemetry must never break a tool call: if a library is missing or credentials cannot be
resolved, the failure is reported once on stderr and the tool runs on.
